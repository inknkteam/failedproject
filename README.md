"Failed Project" is a modpack that revolves around the theme of a pandemic. It takes place in a laboratory where experiments were conducted on human subjects with viruses. When the experiments failed, a pandemic broke out. You play as one of the few survivors before getting infected. In this modpack, you have only one day to prepare before zombies start appearing around you (either at dawn or when torches are lit). Your goal is to survive until the end without getting infected.

The modpack includes various mods related to guns, health regeneration systems, blood moons, diseases, and many other features.

**WARNING: NOT RECOMMENDED FOR OLDER COMPUTERS TO PLAY THIS MODPACK, AS IT MAY LEAD TO GAME CRASHES. IT CAN EVEN DAMAGE YOUR COMPUTER.**

Enjoy playing the game!
